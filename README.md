The "Object Detection in FIFA Game" project leverages YOLOv8, Streamlit, and OpenCV to revolutionize in-game analytics by identifying Team A, Team B, and the Ball. Using YOLOv8, the project offers unparalleled accuracy in real-time object detection, trained on a dataset of 1000 images with over 5000 annotations. OpenCV enhances the project's capability to process video frames efficiently, ensuring precise object identification. Streamlit's deployment facilitates user interaction, showcasing the model's performance in a user-friendly interface. This initiative not only enhances the gaming experience but also opens new avenues for strategic game analysis and coaching tools, marking a significant advancement in sports gaming and AI integration.
